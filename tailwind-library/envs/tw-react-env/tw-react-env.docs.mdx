Use this dev environment on your existing components, by running the following command: 

```
bit env set my-component learnbit-react.tailwind-library/envs/tw-react-env
```


## Create a React workspace

You can create a new React workspace made from this env using the following command:

```
bit new react my-workspace --aspect learnbit-react.tailwind-library/envs/tw-react-env
```

## Compose your own env
